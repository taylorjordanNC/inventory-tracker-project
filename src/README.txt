# Inventory Tracker

This application tracks parts and products within an inventory and works with manually inserted data
to show the application functionality.

## IDE/Language

IDE: IntelliJ Community 2020.2
JDK: Java version 14.0.2
JavaFX: JavaFX 14.0.2.1

## Usage

Navigate the application to add, modify, and delete parts and products within the faux database. Very self-explanatory!
Error messages will show you if you are doing something you should not.

## Contributing
